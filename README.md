Start with the starter code in script.js.

Do `npm install` to get and run `http-server`
(you will need it so that script.jsx works correctly)

#### Create a todo list app:

##### Add:
- a button click handler that takes what is in the input, removes it from the input and `push`es it into the list.
- write the code that renders the list

#### Further
Create a length validation on the input. (Ex., must be more than 1 character and less than 200 characters)

#### Further
Show the validation error to the user

#### Further
Write the code that takes things out of the list.

#### Further
Use `moment.js` npm library to add dates to the todo list.
