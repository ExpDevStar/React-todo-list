# todo-react

Start with the starter code in script.js.

Do `npm install` to get and run `http-server`
(you will need it so that script.js works correctly)

##### Create a todo list app:
##### Add:
- a button click handler that takes what is in the input, removes it and `push`es it into the list.
- write the code that renders the list

#### Further
Create a length validation on the input.

#### Further
Show the validation error to the user

#### Further
Write the code that takes things out of the list.
